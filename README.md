# üöÄ DQ-IDS: Deep Q-Learning Intrusion Detection System

This repository contains a clean, reproducible **PyTorch** implementation of the **DQ-IDS** method ‚Äî an Intrusion Detection System that uses **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** to classify IoT network traffic as **Benign** or **Attack**.

It is based on the paper:

> **DQ-IDS: Deep Q-Learning Intrusion Detection System for IoT Networks**  
> *(See `DQ-IDS.pdf` in this repository)*

## üß† Method Overview

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) use static machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).  
**DQ-IDS** reframes intrusion detection as a **reinforcement learning** problem:

- Each network flow/sample is treated as a **one-step episode**.
- The **agent (DQN)** chooses an **action**: `{Benign, Attack}`.
- It receives **+1 reward if correct, ‚àí1 if wrong**.
- Training uses:
  - **Experience Replay** (to stabilize learning)
  - **Target Network** updates
  - **Epsilon-Greedy exploration** with decay

This allows the IDS to **adapt dynamically**, avoid overfitting to fixed data distributions, and maintain strong performance on new traffic.
